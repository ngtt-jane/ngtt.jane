        <p class="body">
            Digifest is an annual school event where senior Digital Media students showcase their work, 
            demonstrate their progress, and share what they’ve learned throughout the year. The concept of 
            Digifest emphasizes the convergence and interconnection between science, business, art, and technology, 
            reflecting the multidisciplinary nature of the Digital Media field.

    <!--DESIGN PROCESS-->

        <p class="title">Design Procss</p>
        <p class="body">
            For this event, I created a comprehensive visual system that included a poster, announcement card, ID badge, and brochure. 
            Each element was designed to convey the theme of convergence, using visual motifs that represent the blending of these distinct fields. 
            The design process involved careful consideration of typography, color schemes, and layout to ensure that all materials were cohesive and 
            aligned with the event’s theme. This project was developed as part of a class assignment, allowing me to apply my design skills in creating 
            a unified brand identity for an academic event.

            After extensive testing and multiple iterations, the final product emerged as Vroam—an immersive virtual travel app that 
            brings global exploration to users’ fingertips. The inclusion of robust social features fosters a sense of connection and 
            community, making the experience not just about travel, but about sharing and connecting with others who share the same passion.
