        <p class="overview-body">
            "Changes" is a project where I designed the front and back album cover, along with the CD, for Hayd's album "Changes." 
            This project draws inspiration from the International Typographic Style pioneered by Max Huber, who, like Hayd, explored 
            themes of transformation through his work. While Huber revolutionized graphic design with his emphasis on clarity and 
            progressive principles, Hayd’s album delves into personal growth, reflecting on life's challenges and the journey of acceptance.</p>

        <p class="concept-body">
            The concept behind this project was to visually capture the essence of transformation shared between Huber’s innovative graphic design 
            and Hayd’s introspective album. Both Huber’s work and Hayd’s music emphasize simplicity, clarity, and a structured approach to their 
            respective fields. My goal was to create a cohesive design that mirrored these qualities, using bold, minimalist elements to evoke 
            the emotional depth of Hayd’s music while paying homage to Huber’s design principles.</p>

    <!--DESIGN PROCESS-->

        <p class="design-title">DESIGN PROCESS</p>
        <p class="design-body">
            The design process began with a deep exploration of both Huber’s work and the themes present in Hayd’s "Changes." 
            I focused on creating a minimalist aesthetic that incorporated geometric shapes,  and a clear hierarchical structure. 
            Multiple iterations of the album cover and CD design were developed, each refining the balance between visual simplicity 
            and emotional impact. Throughout the process, I ensured that the designs not only reflected the transformative journey 
            depicted in the album but also adhered to the principles of clarity and organization that are central to Huber’s legacy.</p>
