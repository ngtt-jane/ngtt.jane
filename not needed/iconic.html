        <p class="overview-body">
            "Apple IconiTech" is a project where I designed five posters to celebrate Apple's most groundbreaking products: 
            the Macintosh, iMac, iPod, MacBook, and iPhone. These products have not only defined Apple's legacy but have also 
            set new standards in the tech industry, shaping the way we interact with technology today.</p>

    <!--CONCEPTUALIZATION-->

        <p class="concept-title">CONCEPTUALIZATION</p>
        <p class="concept-body">
            The concept behind "Apple IconiTech" was to capture the essence of innovation that each of these products represents. 
            Each poster was designed to highlight the unique features and the revolutionary impact of these devices, showcasing how 
            they have become icons in their own right. By focusing on the visual and functional design elements that made these products stand out, 
            the posters aim to convey the lasting influence of Apple's commitment to innovation and design excellence.</p>

    <!--DESIGN PROCESS-->

        <p class="design-title">DESIGN PROCESS</p>
        <p class="design-body">
            The design process started with extensive research into each product’s history and its significance in Apple's lineup. 
            I explored various design elements, such as typography, color schemes, and imagery, to reflect the unique characteristics of each device. 
            The posters went through multiple iterations, with a focus on creating a cohesive visual narrative that ties all five products together 
            while allowing each to shine individually. The final designs emphasize simplicity, elegance, and a sense of technological advancement, 
            in line with Apple’s design philosophy.</p>
