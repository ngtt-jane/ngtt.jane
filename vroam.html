    <!--CONCEPTUALIZATION & COMMUNITY INSIGHT-->
    <div class="section">
        <p class="title">Conceptualization</p>
        <p class="body">
            The idea originated from a desire to create a mobile app that offers virtual travel experiences, 
            especially for those facing physical or financial limitations. While developing the concept, 
            it became clear that enhancing the sense of community would add significant value. 
            This led to the integration of social media features, allowing users not only to explore 
            the world virtually but also to share their experiences and connect with others, enriching the overall journey.</p>

    <!--PERSONA DEVELOPMENT-->
    <div class="section">
        <p class="title">Personas Development</p>
        <p class="body">
            Personas were crafted early in the process to represent our diverse target audience, including individuals with disabilities, 
            budget-conscious travelers, and tech-savvy explorers. These personas played a crucial role in shaping the app’s design, 
            ensuring that the features and user experience aligned closely with the real needs and desires of our users.

    <!--WIREFRAMING & PROTOTYPING-->
    <div class="section">
        <p class="title">Wireframing & Prototyping</p>
        <p class="body">
            Initial wireframes were sketched to map out the app’s basic structure, navigation, and key functionalities. 
            These low-fidelity wireframes served as a foundation, which was then developed into high-fidelity versions that detailed 
            the visual design and interactions. Interactive prototypes were created from these wireframes, providing a tangible way to 
            test and refine the app’s flow and design elements, leading to informed adjustments based on user interaction.

    <!--USABILITY TESTING & ITERATION-->
    <div class="section">
        <p class="title">Usability Testing & Iteration</p>
        <p class="body">
            Usability testing was conducted with five individuals who share a passion for travel. Their feedback highlighted areas 
            for improvement and was instrumental in refining the app’s design. Iterative changes were made to the user interface, 
            enhancing intuitiveness and optimizing the integration of social media features. These refinements ensured a more seamless 
            and engaging user experience.

    <!--FINAL PRODUCT-->
    <div class="section">
        <p class="title">Final</p>
        <p class="body">
            After extensive testing and multiple iterations, the final product emerged as Vroam—an immersive virtual travel app that 
            brings global exploration to users’ fingertips. The inclusion of robust social features fosters a sense of connection and 
            community, making the experience not just about travel, but about sharing and connecting with others who share the same passion.
