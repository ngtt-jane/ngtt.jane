    <!--CONCEPTUALIZATION & COMMUNITY INSIGHT-->
    <div class="section">
        <p class="title">Conceptualization</p>
        <p class="body">
            The idea behind this project originated from the growing need for electric vehicle (EV) drivers to easily locate charging stations 
            while on the go. The concept was to design a mobile app that would help users quickly and efficiently find the nearest EV charging station, 
            alleviating range anxiety and improving the overall driving experience. While working on the concept, it became evident that offering real-time 
            updates on station availability and additional services such as amenities would greatly enhance the app's value.

    <!--PERSONA DEVELOPMENT-->
    <div class="section">
        <p class="title">Personas Development</p>
        <p class="body">
            Personas were developed early in the process to better understand the needs of the app’s target audience. These personas included daily commuters, 
            long-distance travelers, and eco-conscious drivers who rely on EVs for sustainability. The insights gained from these personas were pivotal in designing 
            features that aligned with their needs, such as filtering charging stations based on charging speed, and availability.

    <!--WIREFRAMING & PROTOTYPING-->
    <div class="section">
        <p class="title">Wireframing & Prototyping</p>
        <p class="body">
            Wireframes were initially sketched to outline the core functionalities of the app, focusing on simplicity and ease of use. Low-fidelity wireframes laid out the user flow, 
            showing how users could search for and navigate to the nearest charging stations. These were developed into high-fidelity wireframes, integrating clean design elements and 
            interactive components. The prototyping phase allowed for refining the app’s layout, making it user-friendly and visually intuitive.

    <!--USABILITY TESTING & ITERATION-->
    <div class="section">
        <p class="title">Usability Testing & Iteration</p>
        <p class="body">
            Since this was a job simulation project and not a real-world initiative, usability testing was not conducted. However, extensive research was performed throughout the design process, 
            informing the decisions made at each stage. Improvements were continually made based on user research, such as optimizing the search functionality and improving map integration for better navigation.

    <!--FINAL PRODUCT-->
    <div class="section">
        <p class="title">Final</p>
        <p class="body">
            The final outcome was a well-thought-out concept for an EV charging station locator app, designed to meet the practical needs of drivers. The user-centered approach ensured that features like filtering, 
            real-time updates, and nearby services were integrated, creating an efficient tool for EV drivers to enhance their journey.
